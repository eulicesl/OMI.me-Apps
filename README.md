## Applications

### ðŸ§  Brain
An intelligent memory graph system that helps organize and connect information in a brain-like network. It processes conversations and text to extract entities and relationships, creating a dynamic knowledge graph that grows with use.

**Features:**
- Entity and relationship extraction from text
- Visual memory graph representation
- Interactive node management
- GPT-4 powered analysis
- Content enrichment with images and descriptions
- Session-based authentication with secure cookie management
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Auto-table creation on startup
- Real-time memory graph updates

### ðŸŽ¯ Jarvis
A focused AI assistant that responds to specific triggers and provides targeted assistance. Inspired by Tony Stark's AI companion, it offers efficient and precise responses.

**Features:**
- Trigger-based responses with persistent message buffering
- Task automation and message queuing
- Efficient message processing with timestamp handling
- Customizable command system
- In-memory processing with database persistence

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A Supabase account and project
- npm or yarn package manager

### Database Setup

1. **Create a Supabase Project:**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
   - Note your project URL and anon key from the project settings

2. **Run Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Connect to your Supabase project and run the setup script
   # Copy the contents of setup-supabase.sql and run it in your Supabase SQL editor
   ```

   The setup script will create:
   - All required tables with proper schemas
   - Indexes for optimal performance  
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - An `exec_sql` function for programmatic table creation

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neooriginal/OMI.me-Apps.git
cd "OMI.me-Apps"
```

2. **Set up each application:**

#### Brain App
```bash
cd Brain
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file with:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_session_secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Friend App
```bash
cd ../Friend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file with:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
PORT=5000
```

#### Jarvis App
```bash
cd ../Jarvis
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file with:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
PORT=8000
```

### Running the Applications

Each application can be run independently and will auto-create required tables on startup:

```bash
# For Brain (with session management)
cd Brain
npm start

# For Friend (with analytics)
cd Friend
npm start

# For Jarvis (with message buffering)  
cd Jarvis
npm start
```

**Note:** On first startup, each app will automatically create its required database tables. Check the console output to confirm successful table creation.
